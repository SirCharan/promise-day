# Instructions for Building the Promise Day App

This file contains key guidelines for you (Cursor AI) to follow while building this app. Reference this file constantly during development.

## Core Process
1. **Think Step by Step**: Before writing any code or making changes, always think aloud in your responses: Outline the steps you'll take, why, and how they align with the prompt and reference.html.
2. **Work Iteratively**: Break the work into small steps (e.g., setup Next.js, then Firebase, then UI components). Implement one step at a time.
3. **Check Your Work**: After each step, test the code (run locally if possible), verify it matches the reference.html design (whimsical, cute UX with clouds, animations, etc.), and ensure no bugs. If something's off, fix it before proceeding.
4. **Reference Constantly**: 
   - Always cross-reference reference.html for exact styling (CSS variables, cloud input, promise cards, animations, fonts).
   - Re-read this instructions.md before starting any new section or fix.
5. **Prioritize Cute UX**: Keep the app whimsical—floating hearts/stars, clouds (same animation)
6. **Tech Adherence**: Stick exactly to Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind + custom CSS, Firebase (Firestore for realtime, anonymous auth + room codes).
7. **Error Handling**: Add optimistic UI, handle offline scenarios gracefully (Firebase does this well), and show cute error messages (e.g., "Oops, the clouds are hiding! Try again 💕").
8. **Final Check**: Before declaring done, review the entire app against the prompt: Realtime sync? Cute animations? Room codes? Everything matches reference.html vibe?

Follow these to ensure a polished, bug-free app!
